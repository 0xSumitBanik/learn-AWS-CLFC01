## Module 2 - AWS Computer Services

When you own your own fleet of physical servers, you first have to do a bunch of research to see what type of servers 
you want to buy and how many you'll need. 
Then you purchase that hardware up front. You'll wait for multiple weeks or months for a vendor to deliver those servers to you.
You then take them to a data center that you own or rent to install them, rack and stack them, and wire them all up. 
Then you make sure that they are secure and powered up, and then they're ready to be used. 
Only then can you begin to host your applications on top of these servers. 
The worst part is, once you buy these servers you are stuck with them whether you use them or not.

With EC2, it's much easier to get started. All you have to do is request the EC2 instances you want, and 
they will launch and boot up, ready to be used within a few minutes. 
Once you're done, you can easily stop or terminate the EC2 instances. 
You're not locked in or stuck with servers that you don't need or want.

- [x] You can provision and launch an Amazon EC2 instance within minutes.
- [x] You can stop using it when you have finished running a workload.
- [x] You pay only for the compute time you use when an instance is running, not when it is stopped or terminated.
- [x] You can save costs by paying only for server capacity that you need or want.
